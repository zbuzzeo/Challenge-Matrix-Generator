## Matrix Generator

Write an function that takes 2 inputs:

1. Number of rows
2. Number of columns

Your function should do the following:

1. Generate a multi-dimensional array with the specified number of rows and columns in the array populated with random numbers between 1 and 100.
2. Sorts the array with natural numeric sorting. You will need to use/write/find a sort function as your argument to the JavaScript `Array.sort()` method for numbers to be sorted as numeric values.
3. Returns the sorted multi-dimensional array

Ex.
`generator(3, 3)`

Output:
[[1, 2 ,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]


### Stretch Goal
Sort the inner arrays so that the first index is in order.

Example (before stretch):  
[[2,3,4], [1,5,6], [7,8,9]]

Output (after stretch):  
[[1,5,6], [2,3,4], [7,8,9]]
